# BetterEditor

## Short Description
This app is basically a combination of the normal Texteditor of Windows 10 and the one from Windows 11.

## Why?
Because the light mode of the normal editor is burning my eyes at midnight I decided to sort of reprogram the one from Windows 11 but extended with features from the one from Windows 10.

Therefore: I would appreciate it, if you report bugs if you find some.
